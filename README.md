This is a very simple [TextMate](http://www.macromates.com) Bundle to help with editing [FreeMarker](http://freemarker.org/ FreeMarker) templates.  It provides a (still incomplete) language definition, and some basic snippets, including some for Spring macros.

## Changelog

### Version 1.2

 * Last version was missing many of the snippets I thought I had included.  Sorry!
 * Including: if, list, assign, local, compress, compress single_line, and macro.

### Version 1.1

 * Added several more snippets for directives: if, else, list, compress, etc.
 * Organized the bundle menu

### Version 1.0

 * Very minimal Language definition that mostly plays well with HTML, but not completely.
 * A few useful snippets for Freemarker tags.
 * One simple HTML template.
